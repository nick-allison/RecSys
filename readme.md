## Introduction
This project presents a **comprehensive recommender system** based on the [Netflix Prize data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data). We explore three popular approaches to recommendation systems: **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)**, and a **Two-Tower architecture**.

To accompany these models, we have included a set of data visualizations and exploratory analyses to better understand user behavior and rating patterns. A simple frontend application is also provided to demonstrate how these models can be integrated into a user-facing product.

## Project Overview

### SVD Model
- **Description**: Implements a matrix-factorization approach using the Surprise library (or standard Python ML libraries).  
- **Notebook**: [SVD.ipynb](path/to/your/SVD.ipynb)  
- **Features**:  
  - Learns latent factors from user-item interactions.  
  - Scalable solution for large rating matrices.  
  - Supports user-based and item-based predictions.  

### NCF Model
- **Description**: Utilizes a deep learning paradigm for collaborative filtering, combining linear and non-linear transformations to capture complex interactions.  
- **Notebook**: [NCF.ipynb](path/to/your/NCF.ipynb)  
- **Features**:  
  - End-to-end learning with embeddings.  
  - Easy to incorporate additional features like user demographics or item metadata.  
  - Often outperforms classical MF approaches on complex datasets.  

### Two-Tower Model
- **Description**: A neural network approach that learns separate embeddings for users and items (two towers) before combining them through a similarity measure (e.g., dot product).  
- **Notebook**: [TwoTower.ipynb](path/to/your/TwoTower.ipynb)  
- **Features**:  
  - Highly scalable for large-scale recommendations.  
  - Allows flexible training objectives (e.g., maximizing dot-product similarity for relevant user-item pairs).  
  - Easy to deploy for real-time recommendations.

## Data
- **Source**: [Netflix Prize data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data)  
- **Description**: The dataset contains user ratings of various movies. It consists of several million ratings, which makes it ideal for testing the performance and scalability of recommender systems.  
- **Usage**:  
  - **Ensure** you have downloaded and extracted the dataset locally or in your Google Drive (if running on Colab).  
  - **Path updates**: Modify the data path in the notebooks to point to the directory where you’ve stored the files.  

*Note*: The dataset usage must comply with its [license and terms](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data/rules).

## Visualization Notebook
- **Notebook**: [Visualization.ipynb](path/to/your/Visualization.ipynb)  
- **Features**:  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for user rating distributions, movie popularity trends, etc.  
  - Visualization of metrics like coverage, diversity, and basic rating statistics.  
  - Performance metrics visualization across the SVD, NCF, and Two-Tower models.  

---

## Frontend
- **Description**: A simple frontend application (e.g., Streamlit, Flask, or React) that showcases how to integrate the models into a user-facing product.  
- **Features**:  
  - Users can search or browse movies.  
  - The recommender provides personalized or similar-item recommendations.  
- **Usage**:  
  - Run the frontend code (for example, using Streamlit):  

        streamlit run app.py

    or (for Flask):  

        flask run

  - Access it locally or via a URL (if deployed) to interact with the system.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   
       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommender-system.git
       cd recommender-system

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   - **Option A**: Using `pip`  
         
         pip install -r requirements.txt

   - **Option B**: Using `conda`  
         
         conda create -n recsys_env python=3.8
         conda activate recsys_env
         pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Acquire Dataset**  
   - Download the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data).  
   - Place the extracted files in a `data` folder or update paths in the notebooks accordingly.

4. **Google Colab** (Optional)  
   - Upload the notebook(s) to your Google Drive or open directly from GitHub.  
   - Make sure to mount your Drive:  

         from google.colab import drive
         drive.mount('/content/drive')

   - Update file paths in the notebooks to reference the dataset in your Drive.

## Usage
1. **Run Notebooks**  
   Open each notebook (SVD, NCF, Two-Tower, Visualization) and run cell by cell.  
   - Ensure that the required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`) are installed.  
   - Modify any paths or hyperparameters as needed.

2. **Training & Evaluation**  
   - In each model notebook, you’ll find sections for **data loading**, **model training**, **hyperparameter tuning**, and **evaluation**.  
   - Experiment with different hyperparameters to observe performance changes.

3. **Launch Frontend**  
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory (or wherever the app code is located).  
   - Run the frontend:  

         streamlit run app.py

     or  

         flask run

   - Access the local URL to interact with the recommendation system.
